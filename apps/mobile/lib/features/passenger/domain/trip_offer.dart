/// A bookable trip as the passenger home screen needs to display it.
///
/// This is a *presentation* model, deliberately decoupled from any API shape.
/// The backend has no passenger-facing "available trips" endpoint yet
/// (`/driver/availabilities` is `requireRole("driver")`), so today it is filled
/// either by a demo source or not at all. When that endpoint lands, add an
/// implementation of `TripOfferSource` that maps it to this type — the widgets
/// do not change.
///
/// Every field the current schema cannot supply is nullable, and the card omits
/// the corresponding row rather than rendering a placeholder or a zero. That
/// keeps the UI honest about what is real:
///
/// | Field            | Backing data                                    |
/// |------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
/// | [driverName]     | `User.name`                                     |
/// | [vehicleLabel]   | `DriverProfile.vehicle_type`                    |
/// | [trustScore]     | `DriverProfile.trust_score` (0–100)             |
/// | [departureAt]    | `DriverRoute.departure_at`                      |
/// | [remainingSeats] | `DriverRoute.remaining_seats`                   |
/// | [priceLabel]     | **none** — no fare column exists                |
/// | [completedTrips] | **none** — not tracked                          |
/// | [photoUrl]       | **none** — no avatar column                     |
/// | [ratingOutOfFive]| **none** — only a 0–100 trust score is stored   |
